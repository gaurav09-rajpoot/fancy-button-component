This is a solution of assignment given by Leapcraft .
In this assignment we have to make some button components based on some critical real world application .
As a solution for this assignment i have made 5 button components with different types,
Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. 
This allows you to work on one component at a time.
You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.
There are five button in the application:-
1.First one is just a normal button while clicking on it. it will show a pop-up message.
2.Second one is a LONG LABEL button  while clicking on it. it will show a pop-up message.
3.Third one is  a  button WITH BORDER while clicking on it. it will show a pop-up message.
4.Fourth one is  button WITH PREFIX ICON  while clicking on it. it will show a pop-up message.
5.Fifth one is COLOR CHANGER  button while clicking on it. it will change the color the button.
